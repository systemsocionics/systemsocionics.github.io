<b>What is the most useful tool you own? How do you use it? Do you use it in ways different from the norm? Why or why not?</b> <br/>
My most useful tool is my phone. I use it as a way of distraction, or for research purposes. I listen to music, watch videos, talk to people and read stuff there. I use it WAY more than usual and I do not consume popular media from it,<small>[8|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;"> since I usually need encouragement to start a new thing,</span><small>|8]</small> I am scared for it to be a bad experience overall, <small>[9|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">and I am not bored with my usual routine.</span><small>|9]</small><br/>
 <br/>
<b>What makes a job well done? What standards do you use? When should you deviate from this standard?</b><br/>
A job well done proves something, shows results and is effective. <small>[10|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">Standards are used by comparing the work to the usual amount of profit, how useful it is for future applications.</span><small>|10]</small> It improves something more than the norm, if it requires praise.<br/>
 <br/>
<b>How do you approach working with poorly functioning technology? Do you have a different approach to it than others? Why?</b><br/>
<small>[11|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">I hate low-end phones and laptops I use, but I cope with them by playing low-end games which are story-rich instead of looking good.</span><small>|11]</small> But freezing, slow processing and shutting down frustrates me a lot. <small>[12|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I search for solutions in the net when a problem occurs.</span><small>|12]</small></td>

<b>What does “logical” mean to you? Does it match the normal view? How do you know you are behaving in a logical way?</b><br/>
<small>[13|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Logical is to be without any inconsistency, whenever I argue with someone, trying to find what is "logical" in the moment, I look for contradictions, between itself, or the situation.</span><small>|13]</small> <small>[14|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">The norm of logicality can be found in mathematics, pure logic helps us identify and move forward in society</span><small>|14]</small>, but I do not believe that the "normal view" corresponds with mathematics. <small>[15|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Logical acts become much more subjective when we take away the numbers and the formulas, our perceptions simply are not in line with each other at times</span><small>|15]</small>, causing conflict. <small>[16|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">I know that I am logical when I see everything align with each other, every piece falls into its place, the desired reaction comes true, or evolves into something different,</span><small>|16]</small>  which is the new truth. <small>[17|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">I adapt to the truth I find, only when I am fully convinced.</span><small>|17]</small></td>

<b>Socrates is claimed to have said: “I know only one thing: that I know nothing.” Is it logical? Why? If someone disagreed with you, how would you respond?</b><br/>
<small>[18|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">To know nothing. How does one know nothing?</span><small>|18]</small> <small>[19|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">If we take a look at it from another aspect, perhaps we never learn anything real, and everything is just our perception, a distorted version of something.</span><small>|19]</small> <small>[20|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">But then, what about your perception of your own thoughts?</span><small>|20]</small> <small>[21|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Even then, what happens inside us is purely physical and our internal thoughts depend on our brain activity, so even when we indeed recognize our own thoughts, they are not the real thing that was processed, just the distorted version of it. So when we say that we only know one thing, and that it is nothing, we free ourselves from the distorted version of the world, and accept our defeat in objectivity.</span><small>|21]</small> If we were to say that we know nothing, we could actually recognize what we lack, instead of what is. <small>[22|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">We lack the truth, so it is logical to say that the only thing we can learn is that we know nothing in this world.</span><small>|22]</small></td>

<b>How do you see justice and injustice play out in the world? What are your opinions of it? What should be done about it? Why?</b><br/>
<small>[23|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">This world is not fair. Injustice is everywhere, and we ignore most of it for our own good.</span><small>|23]</small> <small>[24|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Inequality of prosperity is one example, no one cares about the inequality of opportunity while pretending to fight against racism.</span><small>|24]</small> <small>[25|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">Some races have it worse than others, simply because they lack the technology or the industry to improve, and they have worse education which leads to them electing corrupt leaders, and this is an endless loop.</span><small>|25]</small> <small>[26|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">People are most convinced when they are materially secure, and you can manipulate all people with enough money, and I hate this.</span><small>|26]</small> <small>[27|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">We are not moral creatures, we never were. While we can not fix our nature</span><small>|27]</small>, <small>[28|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">at least we can enforce some laws to equalize the distribution of resources between the world to help the less fortunate people</span><small>|28]</small>, <small>[29|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">but then again the next question comes: "What do we gain from it?"</span><small>|29]</small> And that is why, justice is just a part of an utopia, our morals and smiles are fake, <small>[30|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">we fight against the inequalities we made up to cover up the bigger problems, and nothing will get solved anytime soon.</span><small>|30]</small></td>

<b>Describe your view on money. What can it do for someone, and how does it impact people?</b><br/>
<small>[31|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Money is a means of influence and power.</span><small>|31]</small> <small>[32|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">It can buy anything in this world, and you can do anything you want with it, if you are smart enough. It improves your attractiveness and power over the environment by a huge amount, you can improve your life, your routine, how you take care of yourself, everything.</span><small>|32]</small> As long as you create a zone of security for people, they will be attached to you. It is especially easier in romance, or in business. <small>[33|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Money is how power is distributed, and you have to get as much as you can as possible to advance your life forward, to become more powerful.</span><small>|33]</small> I have accepted the fact that people will not accept you if you are financially unstable, no matter what. That drives me to gain the most amount of money I can in my life, I can never get enough. <small>[34|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">This world plays a game of territory, and you have to expand in order to attract others. </span><small>|34]</small><small>[35|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">This sense of power usually changes people, makes them more confident, or more power-hungry, more authoritarian. Power corrupts people, but power is also needed and wanted in this world, people like corrupted people and follow them if the said corrupted people are smart enough.</span><small>|35]</small> That is why, objectively, money is the greatest path to satisfaction.</td>

<b>How do you understand territory? Who or what would you consider as part of your territory? When is it appropriate to expand your territory? Why?</b><br/>
Our territory is what place we have purchased with our money. Be it a house, a shop, or a factory. <small>[36|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Our territory gives us influence over the inhabitants of it, if you pay the rent and the bills alone, your words reign true if you are capable enough. The same goes for everyone too, if you support the area, the company, and the city with resources and money, you have influence over it.</span><small>|36]</small> It is appropriate to expand your territory when you are strong enough to handle the responsibility, because if you aren't, everything will fall apart and everyone will hate you, belittle you for your weakness, you will fall down in the hierarchy and possibly even end up homeless.</td>

<b>How aware are you of your appearance and economic standing? Is it important to manage this? Do your views match the norm?</b><br/>
 <br/>
<small>[40|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">I am not always aware of my appearance, but I am aware of my economic status and how it affects my life. I think that as I grow up, I will take care of my appearance well though. And when it comes to my economic status, I come from a poor background, which makes me conscious of it.</span><small>|40]</small> <small>[41|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">I am very well aware of what I lack, and I try very hard to get back what I never had.<br/>

 <br/>
<b>What makes someone a strong-willed person? Would you consider yourself one? Why or why not?</b><br/>

<b>Describe what “emotional distance” means to you. In what ways do you adjust this, and for what reasons?</b><br/>
It is the barriers we use to protect our emotional integrity. <small>[61|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">It is perfectly logical for us to not let strangers get closer to us, and let strangers be friends over enough time.</span><small>|61]</small><small>[62|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd"> I deactivate my barriers if I feel like that person is trustable and good, and reactivate if the opposite happens.

<b>What makes someone a true friend? How does this differ from other kinds of relationships? Does your understanding of this fit the norm?</b><br/>
<small>[66|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">A true friend is one you share anything with, and get anything in return. You compromise for them and they do the same, you support them with care and get back the equal amount, if not more.</span><small>|66]</small> <small>[67|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Normal relationships are faker than this, and there is always a factor of benefit, which I desire no such relation to in my true relationships.</span><small>|67]</small> So, I would say that it does not fit the norm.<br/>

<small>[68|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I view love and desire as an unequal competition which I was very lucky in.

<b>What is the meaning of life? Should life’s meaning be personal or collectively shared by humanity? Why?</b><br/>
Meaning is a human concept, life has no concern with such things. <small>[71|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">What we perceive and how we do it is subjective</span><small>|71]</small>, <small>[72|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">and that is all there is to it.</span><small>|72]</small> No single meaning is existent, just brainstorming ideas about it, so it is pretty personal in itself.<br/>
 <br/>
<b>What would you consider to be your core character traits - good and bad? Do you feel like you’re living up to your potential? Why?</b><br/>
<small>[73|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I am not sure about my potential, nor am I good at using it.</span><small>|73]</small> <small>[74|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">All I can say is that I used to be a kind kid</span><small>|74]</small>, <small>[75|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">but no skills in particular. Now I lost that as well, so, it is safe to assume that I am probably not living up to my potential.</span><small>|75]</small><br/>
 <br/>
<b>What makes something have potential? How do you find new opportunities and how would you decide which would be the best?</b><br/>
<small>[76|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Potential is to have value in the future, therefore one who can see it can manipulate the future the best. </span><small>|76]</small>To find new opportunities, I usually look up online to get more information about it or leave it to someone else.<br/>
 <br/>
<b>What constitutes a good idea? Do ideas need to be realistic to be worthwhile? Why or why not?</b><br/>
A good idea needs to propose something and should not be easily broken. <small>[77|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Be it realistic or not, if it advances the discussion, or the society as a whole,</span><small>|77]</small> it is very valuable, and should not be taken lightly.<br/>

<b>How do events change people? In what ways do individual events impact the larger narrative of life?</b><br/>
Various events change characters and how they behave. We possess a fluid way of personality, and it can be shaped by the environment, shocking events.<small>[81|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;"> Every single individual event forms up to affect our whole story of our life, and when we will be close to death</span><small>|81]</small>, we will only remember a distorted and mixed version of it.<br/>
 <br/>
<b>Describe what “the flow of time” means to you. How do people feel and experience it? Is this the norm?</b><br/>
I would describe "the flow of time" to be the chain of events we have not much to interfere with, as we are flowing just as fast. <small>[82|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">Cause and effect results in a helpless spiral of life, and some shine more than the others during the process. This is probably close to the norm, as we usually feel helpless against the cruel flow of time.</span><small>|82]</small><br/>
 <br/>
<b>How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?</b><br/>
<small>[83|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">I usually anticipate events by indicators of it, there is always a sign that it will happen, you just have to be observant enough to do it.</span><small>|83]</small> I do fail to accomplish this when I feel apathetic, though.<br/>
 <br/>
<b>How timely of a person are you? How do you view hurriedness and lateness in yourself and others?</b><br/>
<small>[84|</small><span style="background-color:#d9d2e9;">I am a very timely person, and I always ask for what time a certain event might happen, for example.</span><small>|84]</small> <small>[85|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I would consider myself impatient and if I am late, then I probably didn't want to do it in the first place.</span><small>|85]</small><br/>
 <br/>
<b>In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?</b><br/>
Timing is always important, with the right timing you can do anything, and <small>[86|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I try to wait for the right timing a lot, only to miss the opportunity most times</span><small>|86]</small>.</td>
