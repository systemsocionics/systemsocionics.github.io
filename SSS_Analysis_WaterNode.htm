<b>What is work in your view? Besides money, what does a job provide? Are there parameters that determine how well you’ll work? If so, what are they?</b><br/>
	<small>[1|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Abstractly, work is just something we do that expends energy for an external output.</span><small>|1]</small> That said, I find it more revealing to define work by the purposes that work can fulfill. <small>[2|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I think work can fulfill several purposes to many people. It can be fulfillment, survival, technological progress, a way to provide for others, freedom (rising through financial hierarchies), suppression (a way for others to profit off of one’s labor), and also possibly even a way towards stability.</span><small>|2]</small> <small>[3|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Jobs can provide the same things of course, though since it is a more specific term I’d add the idea of community and comradery to it - as a job is a designation of work within a social organization. </span><small>|3]</small><br/>
	<small>[4|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">There are several parameters I can identify that help me work that I’ve realized over the years, but this list is nowhere near exhaustive. A means for intellectual problem solving, a feeling that I am progressing and helping others around me progress towards their best, comfort (think ideal working area, not to load, comfortable seats, good food), good sleep, friendly people, open minded people (willing to talk about processes and how to improve them), and a connection with the team members I work with.</span><small>|4]</small></td>

<b>You’re working with a professional. How do you know they’re a professional? How would you evaluate the quality of their performance?</b><br/>

<b>What makes a job well done? What standards do you use? When should you deviate from this standard?</b><br/>
	Frankly, this question makes me feel irritated <small>[9|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">   </span><small>[10|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">because I think that this is drastically dependent on the field of the job and environment, and generally describing it I feel encourages people to exert themselves above what is necessary (if they want to of course, go for it)</span><small>|9]</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;"></span><small>|10]</small><br/>
	Just to entertain the question though, I’ll answer as if someone is confused about the concept of what “well done” generally means. <small>[11|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">A “job well done” is when you fulfill the requirements of a task you need to do, but in a way that is a significant measure above the bare minimum needed to complete the task.</span><small>|11]</small></td>

<b>How do you approach working with poorly functioning technology? Do you have a different approach to it than others? Why?</b><br/>

<b>What does “logical” mean to you? Does it match the normal view? How do you know you are behaving in a logical way?</b><br/>
<small>[18|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">To me being logical means several things: inner consistency, and if applicable: consistency with evidence presented and conceptual consistency with how logic is applied.</span><small>|18]</small> <small>[19|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Logical also means acting consistent with one’s beliefs, and understanding other people’s understandings so that you can convey/teach your message clearly. </span><small>|19]</small><br/>

<b>What makes hierarchies work? Why do they have power over people and things? Is it always necessary to follow them? Why or why not?</b><br/>
<small>[22|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">Generally, hierarchies work due to a few facets: simplicity of thought, clear delineation of group decision making, also protection via power/competition (this is certainly not always true, but it is a societal norm).</span><small>|22]</small> <small>[23|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">Hierarchies have power over people for those reasons, but also more nefarious reasons - such as fear, the looming promise of climbing the hierarchy</span><small>|23]</small> <small>[24|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">and subsequently getting both more power and (correlatively) resources.</span><small>|24]</small> <small>[25|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I definitely don’t think hierarchies are always necessary to follow - especially a hierarchy that encourages unethical norms or doesn’t work effectively - such as incompetent leadership due to false confidence and causing people to follow them or leadership that gets out of their depth,</span><small>|25]</small> or hierarchies that have poorly ran decision making operations.</td>

<b>Socrates is claimed to have said: “I know only one thing: that I know nothing.” Is it logical? Why? If someone disagreed with you, how would you respond?</b><br/>
<small>[26|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">It’s logical depending on the perspective you look at it</span><small>|26]</small> - <small>[27|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">on surface level, it is not: the statement is a paradox, and he clearly understood many things, regardless of their mechanical accuracy.</span><small>|27]</small> <small>[28|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">That said, it is logical in the sense of the message he is sending - to see yourself as knowing nothing, you detach from the ego attached with “knowing” things and inherently puts one in the position of being a learner</span><small>|28]</small>, and hence enables one to have a mindset to learn more effectively, and therefore, be more “logical” or “correct” with minimal moral implications due to minimizing ego. <br/>
	I am addressing several angles here so I have a hard time seeing someone disagreeing here - but if someone disagreed with me, <small>[29|</small><span style="background-color:#d9d2e9;">I’d ask about their point of view to understand why they do - if I see their perspective as dismissive, I will just avoid engaging, but otherwise I’ll have a discussion to see if I can learn a new perspective. </span><small>|29]</small></td>

<b>What makes a system equitable or inequitable? Should fairness be the primary goal of any system? Why or why not?</b><br/>
<small>[30|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">An equitable system is one that accommodates individuals with disadvantaged circumstances with those with ideal circumstances so that they can input a similar amount of work and get a similar output based on work input. This also extends to opportunities that arise for individuals with disparate circumstances, opportunities should be relatively equal based on work given by individuals regardless of circumstance. </span><small>|30]</small>Inequities are when  neither of the above happen: when individuals with disadvantaged backgrounds do not have the same output of work or opportunities. <small>[31|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">FYI: I use general language such as “similar” or “relatively” because social systems always have a randomness element to it that cannot be accounted for with just structure.</span><small>|31]</small><br/>
<small>[32|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Fairness only matters in the nature that it applies to people (or animals, I suppose in some contexts), so specifically, yes, social systems should always have the primary goal of fairness, though not strict fairness if it will make the system function poorly.</span><small>|32]</small> <small>[33|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Fairness is important in that people feel that they are treated fairly, builds trust in social systems, and encourages the potential of people as they will be able to interact with the system in a way that genuinely reflects their abilities and effort.</span><small>|33]</small></td>

<b>How do you experience and understand fear? Is fear an effective way to control people? Can the use of it be justified? Why or why not?</b><br/>
	I experience fear as a visceral impulse to check and protect against threats, by ensuring I’m secure through sufficient physical protections and circumstances. I understand fear as an emotion we have to defend ourselves from threats. <br/>
	<small>[34|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">I do think fear can be an effective way to control people in the sense that it can achieve its purpose, that said, fear encourages people to remove the threat - while following orders is a way to remove the threat temporarily, the permanent solution is for them to remove that of which they fear. So if your goal is long term power and comfort (as you’ll need to protect yourself) fear is not effective.</span><small>|34]</small> I think use of it might be justified in extreme circumstances, if one is doing it for the good of others they control due to themselves counteracting the extreme circumstances due to fear (ironic, I know). Otherwise, generally no, I do not think the use of fear is justified as it generally lowers the quality of life for everyone involved.</td>

<b>How do you manage your external presentation - like your names, profile pictures, or the brand of clothing? What motivates these choices? What do the choices of others say about them?</b><br/>
	<small>[41|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I’ve always felt a bit clueless about this, usually relying on opinions of others for clothing or standards I have to abide by.

<b>Give an example of something gratifying to your physical senses. What makes it enjoyable? How would you create the conditions to experience it?</b><br/>
<small>[49|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I really enjoy hot chicken strips from a local restaurant. I have been eating it a lot recently.

With the sauce, it is a mix of mayo, ketchup, horseradish, and a little diced jalapenos, so I’d mix that, and serve on the side with the finished chicken.</span><small>|50]</small></td>

I generally address it as it comes - is it pain or discomfort that will help me in some way? Is it bearable and won’t distract me from immediate priorities?

<b>Describe in detail how you’d design a room, house, or office. What would you prioritize when it comes to building an enjoyable space? Why?</b><br/>
I actually am in the process of designing my office space. I first evaluate the needs of the space - in this case, it would be that I need good lighting on camera for my work space, two desks for work and personal use, isolation in the background of my work space, and simplicity of interaction with the space. Then I figure out the orientation of what I currently own and need to buy - for this I already had two desks, chairs, and tech gear.

<b>How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe such unfoldments in your environment?</b><br/>
	<small>[101|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">I tend to anticipate events unfolding by paying attention to key progressions in how something could exist or shape. Relationships are a great example - there isn’t usually just “one” event that unfolds that makes a relationship happen, but you’ll see key indicators from each of the individuals in a relationship that slowly erupt that you can pay attention to and predict how events will unfold based on those indicators.</span><small>|101]</small> <small>[102|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">You can observe similar unfoldings by paying attention to how the world’s processes work - such as the season cycle, patterns of plant growth, cities slowly descending or ascending from patterns of crime - and thus you’ll start to see the factors that co-mingle with such events, such as light, rain, the structure of a city government changing, other external events (like covid) and how that shapes out related variables such as less cars, less people using public transport,</span><small>|102]</small> or how it changes how cities are built and therefore affects what is the ideal locations for plant life. Or even with this, you might see that concrete allows for less water absorption, starving some plants of dehydration and drowning others depending on how it flows.</td>

<b>In what situations is timing important? How do you know the time is right to act? How do you feel about waiting for the right moment?</b><br/>
	<small>[106|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">Timing is important when there is a large upside to doing something in a particular time frame due to confounding variables, which I would call an “opportune” time. This is in comparison to doing this at a wrong time, and also it depends on if one can even execute in this “opportune” time frame in the first place. If you are rolling slots, for instance, even if you could know the exact measurement of milliseconds needed to get the perfect answer, executing it would be extremely difficult or nigh impossible. </span><small>|106]</small><small>[107|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">In circumstances where an “opportune” time exists, the right time to act is when all the confounding variables are in generally the best place that they could be, even if they aren’t perfect (because sometimes they never will be or it’s not worth waiting for the perfect time).</span><small>|107]</small> <small>[108|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">I feel that waiting for the right moment is considering all of these aspects - how ideal is a certain scenario, how likely is are all the confounding variables to be aligned, can you even execute in the timeframe these variables are aligned, what is the opportunity cost of waiting for a more “opportune” time, and does executing an “opportune” time even make a significant impact?</span><small>|108]</small> (if it doesn’t, thinking about this is moot)</td>

	I see the world as an intermix of natural forces and human societies. Human societies have taken over much of the natural world and the natural world is generally subjugated by humans. <small>[109|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">To understand the world is to understand the structure and preferences of human society, how nature operates and the interplay between human societies and nature.</span><small>|109]</small><br/>
	Many of the problems in the world are currently due to and created by human societies in reference to themselves or nature, regarding exploitation of our own society and nature. I’ll address both ends of the spectrum in terms of problems and how they’re interrelated.<br/>
	<small>[110|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">In regards to human societies towards nature, the crux of our issues involve our invasiveness towards nature, which are related to our city building (in that the city does not incorporate or account for co-living with nature), mining, carbon dioxide creating activities. Some people work to mitigate our effect on the environment, but the crux of the issue is that we are streamlining our processes for max productivity rather than sustainability with existing systems.</span><small>|110]</small> <small>[111|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">If not changed, human society will proceed to inefficiently eat most of the resources on our planet and thus the eco-systems, plant, and animal life that comes with it.</span><small>|111]</small><br/>
	<small>[112|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Human societies also create similar problems towards themselves. If they are left to their own devices, some will find ways to exploit not only nature, but other humans for power and progression. This creates an unequal society, which allows the exploitative humans to continue to force their hand with the more power they get.</span><small>|112]</small> This not only is abhorrent towards nature, but the overall citizens of the society. To solve this, we should aim for governments that are preventative to creation of this power dynamic or past authoritarian (or pseudo-authoritarian) structures.<br/>
	<small>[113|</small><span style=background-color:#f4cccc>On a separate note - there are problems with the United States I notice in regards to how we encourage inefficiencies in our power structures, resource management, space management, and dynamics of space. We’ve built a system that encourages us to ship produce from around the world instead of locally, that have us commute in boxes every day from work requiring additional billions of dollars of maintaining infrastructure, live in areas where we barely connect with our neighbors next door, and cities that pave and destroy natural space in the name of urbanism.</span><small>|113]</small> The individual solutions to solve these problems are multifaceted, however much of the original cause is related to the exploitation power that those in society use to push our government towards these policies in the name of their own gain.</td>
