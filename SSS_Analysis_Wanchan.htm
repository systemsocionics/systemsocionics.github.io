<b>What is work in your view? Besides money, what does a job provide? Are there parameters that determine how well you’ll work? If so, what are they?</b><br/>
Work is some kinda activity you do to get some kinda result out of it. <small>[1|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I just got the image of pushing an abstract object to move it and it turning to an “activity” in my head lol.</span><small>|1]</small> Besides money, what a job provides depends on the person and the nature of the job I guess? Escapism for some, energy, making sure you’re productive as a member of society, etc. <small>[2|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">Most jobs have some sort of condition/standards like, painters should have good knowledge of colour theory and how to work with a brush, doctors should have good medical knowledge, etc.</span><small>|2]</small> I think the more you fit the qualifications for those standards, the more your work will turn out acceptable.</td>

<b>You’re working with a professional. How do you know they’re a professional? How would you evaluate the quality of their performance?</b><br/>
Their knowledge on the subject at hand, how good they are at applying it in practice and their qualifications, I suppose. <small>[3|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">For example, whether someone’s good at drawing let’s say. Their technical skills like use of colour, line work, how steady their hand is when holding a pen, their use of canvas space and composition, etc would be what’s used to determine their skill level and performance.</span><small>|3]</small></td>

<b>What is the most useful tool you own? How do you use it? Do you use it in ways different than the norm? Why or why not?</b><br/>

<b>What makes a job well done? What standards do you use? When should you deviate from this standard?</b><br/>
A job is well done if it fits the criteria. <small>[7|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">Different jobs come with different responsibilities, I just have to look over what’s expected and provide it. For example, I was working in this one group assignment: my job was to research material. I browsed the hell out of the internet and provided enough articles. I think that was a completed job where I did what’s expected.</span><small>|7]</small> For some jobs, it depends on the degree of the consequences whether you should deviate from what’s expected or not. Like, if I was a surgeon working with heart surgery, I would be too scared of doing things not by the books lol. <small>[8|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">But sometimes, I get lazy as hell working on assignments for class. So when my laziness wins over I just don’t bother giving a high quality result.</span><small>|8]</small></td>

<b>What does “logical” mean to you? Does it match the normal view? How do you know you are behaving in a logical way?</b><br/>

I think it does match the normal view, I remember a dictionary definition I saw a long time ago tho not properly so probably.</span><small>|12]</small> Lol.

<b>What makes hierarchies work? Why do they have power over people and things? Is it always necessary to follow them? Why or why not?</b><br/>
Hierarchies work due to the importance given to them. <small>[13|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">They have power because people believe in them I guess. </span><small>|13]</small>I don’t think it’s always necessary to follow them?<small>[14|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;"> Like, when it comes to familial hierarchies it goes parents > children.

<b>Describe your view on money. What can it do for someone, and how does it impact people? </b><br/>
<small>[17|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">Money is something that’s pretty important in life tbh. There’s almost nothing that it can’t get you– well, when it comes to your comfort and well-being that is. It’s the number 1 most important resource in life.</span><small>|17]</small> <small>[18|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">The more you have, the more you can get. Most people are, to a certain degree, pretty dependent on money tbh whether they realise it or not. You can’t get by without money in this society (at least not comfortably). All the resources you have to ensure your quality of life – medical bills, food, living space, education, clothes, other basic necessities, etc all come to you because of money.</span><small>|18]</small> <small>[19|</small><span style="background-color:#d9d2e9;">So honestly, only someone naive would say something like “oh wealth doesn’t matter” etc. in the general sense</span><small>|19]</small> <small>[20|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">(like it can personally not matter to you yourself but to claim it doesn’t on a grander scale would be ignoring reality).</span><small>|20]</small></td>

<b>How do you understand territory? Who or what would you consider as part of your territory? When is it appropriate to expand your territory? Why?</b><br/>
Everything within your sphere of influence and possession is part of your territory, whether it’s material possessions or even social spheres. <small>[21|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Everyone has their own “space” though what’s included in that space is really dependent on the individual tbh. For instance, a simple coffee mug that I bought would be part of my “territory”.</span><small>|21]</small> <small>[22|</small><span style=background-color:#f4cccc>When I gather a group of people I love to hang out together, their shared presence in the group due to the meaning they give to me in my life and time would also be part of my “territory/space”.</span><small>|22]</small> <small>[23|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">Whether it’s appropriate to “expand” this depends on the situation and need. When it comes to material possessions, I can be somewhat greedy honestly, so I always want something to satisfy me and I mayy have been a very selfish person in the past (0-15 years) because of this, who would take away others’ stuff for myself because I wanted it :’). For instance, more money, more of that food I like (without wanting to share it with anyone because someone taking more bites would mean less for myself lol), more pretty clothes I like, etc. Honestly, it mostly (like a good 80%) of the time just boils down to “because I can and I want to”.</span><small>|23]</small></td>

<b>Follow-up:</b><br/>
<small>[24|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">in terms of people, since everyone has a generic sense of personal space, depending on their personality and/or your relationship level with them it's necessary to be mindful of such things lest u end up distressing them. </span><small>|24]</small><small>[25|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">With ppl I'm very close to tho, I can be invasive and push them around bc ik they'll trust me and let me do whatever I want. With those who're not that close, I'm more mindful. With those who're a step above acquaintance and close but below the innermost circle of closeness, it depends really on how their personality is.</span><small>|25]</small></td>

If it's just about influence in a general sense tho, it depends on the agenda? like, a lot of "appropriateness" just depends on how u do it and come across tbh. Material space can be expanded depending on material need (well, some ppl are greedy tho ig, not that I blame them). That kind of stuff is necessary anyway, if u want a comfortable life for urself and/or ur loved ones or whatever other reason u might have.</td>

<b>How do you manage your external presentation - like your names, profile pictures, or the brand of clothing? What motivates these choices? What do the choices of others say about them?</b><br/>
<small>[26|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">How I present my appearance to others depends on the situation and mood lol. I’m honestly a very lazy person, so things such as makeup, looking pretty, etc are things I do only when I’m in the mood to look pretty or when I absolutely have to (like some occasion).</span><small>|26]</small> <small>[27|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">For me, clothes and makeup are about self-expression of myself. However, when I get lazy I mostly stick to comfort and convenience over putting effort. I don’t care much for brands (coping because more like I can’t afford to lol). I avoid fast-fashion due to guilt over its ethical implications and due to monetary reasons… I mostly thrift.</span><small>|27]</small> Stuff like names and profile pictures, I choose them based on what looks appealing/what “represents” me. Certain images/items have certain vibes to them. And honestly, people’s choices over their external presentation does say a lot about them tbh– their confidence, interests, etc. <small>[28|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">How they move, talk or sound, etc too.</span><small>|28]</small></td>

</b><b>How aware are you of your appearance and economic standing? Is it important to manage this? Do your views match the norm?</b><br/>
<small>[29|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">I’m aware of how I appear in the sense that people’s assessment of my presentation can be easy to spot.</span><small>|29]</small> My economic standing is… not so great lol. Yes, my parents have enough inheritance money and support me when I need it but when talking more-so in terms of my *own* resources and what I made on my own – I’m still wayyy behind in terms of what they already have for me (I honestly have little insecurities at times due to my more sheltered and “dependent” upbringing from my parents). <small>[30|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I think managing your external presentation and also taking your economic standing into account is obviously very important (the first point might not be so obvious to some though). Your presentation is the first thing people notice about you when you’re a stranger– nuances about your character is mostly an afterthought at that very beginning stage of interaction. So depending on the situation and need, you can leverage this I guess. </span><small>|30]</small></td>

<b>Follow-up:</b> <b>What does leverage mean here?</b><br/>
Maybe "leverage" was the wrong word to use.<small>[31|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;"> I meant to say that appearance/presentation is important on a very general scale and if you feel the need to make a nice impression atm it's important to take into account such things.</span><small>|31]</small> Like, when interacting with strangers who don't know you too well what's the primary thing people pay attention to at such settings?

<b>What makes someone a strong-willed person? Would you consider yourself one? Why or why not?</b><br/>
<small>[32|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">A person’s strength is dependent on their level of perseverance. The more determined and consistent in maintaining this particular psychological state, the more “strong-willed” a person is considered generally. </span><small>|32]</small>Now, as for me, personally? It depends. I wouldn’t necessarily call myself “strong-willed” because: 1) I’m lazy as fuck 2) I’m too impatient and hesitant at times. I’ve had someone call me mentally strong in life, but I’m not sure honestly. I think I’m just petty and stubborn.</td>

<b>Choose one of the following: art, clothing, photography, graphic design. What makes something well-designed in that area? How do the individual components work together to generate the experience?</b><br/>
Art: whether it looks good together depends on how the various components it’s made up of – colors, composition, use of space, brush-work (if it’s a traditional piece), etc work together. The more harmonious their degree of interaction, the “better” it looks in terms of presentation. For instance, I’ll use this one artist I follow as an example to illustrate my answer: Liduke (they’re a prominent anime artist who worked on this game called Arknights). <small>[33|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">They use a very painterly style with desaturated colours and lots of grayscale. Basic technical skills aside, I think what makes their artwork compelling in terms of its visuals is their minimal details on the background (like its sorta fading away), a more realistic style of shading done with a brush with soft texture, and the way they highlight and bring attention to important parts of the piece via colouring them brighter to guide and attract your eyes over there.</span><small>|33]</small></td>

It’s the way there’s just the right amount of cheese, the right amount of crust and the oregano, pizza sauce and salted corn blend together in your tastebuds that feels like “yess”.</span><small>|34]</small> I’ve never really made pizza myself so if I had to “create the conditions to experience it” I’d probably look up a recipe online on how to start, I suppose.</td>

<b>How do you manage pain and discomfort? Give an example. Is this different from the norm? </b><br/>
Hmm it depends on the degree of pain and discomfort really. If it’s minor, I can do just fine and go through with things. However, if it’s bad I’m just gonna be a dramatic hoe about it ig. <small>[35|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">For example, I had really bad period cramps last time. It felt like something heavy weighing on your stomach and your inner thighs, and getting attacked in your uterus walls. I couldn’t get up without feeling like “I wanna kms and be reborn in a male body” so I took 3 days off and lied in bed trying to sleep the pain away. The pain felt nauseating at times so I changed bed positions quite a lot of times to see which is most comfortable. And I took some painkillers while hoping for it to be over</span><small>|35]</small>.<small>[36|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;"> I think any normal person who has experienced period cramps to this degree would do the same if they’re sane and value their well-being.</span><small>|36]</small></td>

<b>Describe in detail how you’d design a room, house, or office. What would you prioritize when it comes to building an enjoyable space? Why?</b><br/>
Ooh I love decorating/organizing spaces tbh so if someone assigns me an activity like this I’d probably enjoy it very much as long as I get to do everything lol. This is why I have like, a dozen carrds and pinterest boards lol. Well, I’ll use how I’d decorate my personal room as an example (my sacred space which unfortunately got taken over by my brother after I moved out…).

<b>Describe what “emotional distance” means to you. In what ways do you adjust this, and for what reasons?</b><br/>
“Emotional distance” is just the level of connection you feel you have with another person tbh. <small>[64|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">For instance, with someone who is a fresh stranger, obviously neither of you know each other very well so the distance would be big.

I’m generally accepting of people but I only let in my closest circle those who I feel a great compatible connection with. So with her, I gauged her character, I actually didn’t end up liking her much regrettably due to a variety of reasons.     </span><small>[66|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">However, saying that upright to her wouldn’t be appropriate and might ruin my connection with her completely, which would be bad since it’s an important connection in case of a situation where need in any way emerges.

School days: very boring, I skip most classes unless they’re important and sleep. I wake up, eat (if I actually have the energy to even get up from bed), even getting myself to the bathroom can be a chore at times lol. I think I once spent 2 days without eating anything because it felt too much like a chore and I couldn’t even get myself up. My friend texted me the other day, so I got inspired from her and forcefully dragged myself even though I felt hopeless to force myself to have a normal weekday.</td>
