<small>[1|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Work is necessary to keep society moving forward. I don’t think that work is *everything* but it is good for basic wellbeing to have a “role” in society (something to do) Baker, butcher, doctor, lumber, etc. I feel like we are losing touch with the purpose of “jobs” these days, it really should be a societal role and not vital to living or dying. </span><small>|1]</small><small>[2|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">YES I work well when it isn’t life or death. I just can’t handle the stress of things or calling the shots on serious choices</span><small>|2]</small>. I like being creative, learning from others, and honestly just vibing, maybe helping others find what they like too. (More of a discussion than a black or white scenario.)</td>

<small>[3|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Honestly, if they are being an ass I’ll back away, credentials or not. Being an ass as in letting their pride get in the way of teaching someone else, or them gatekeeping information, OR when they make a mistake and insist they didn’t. Prideful people.</span><small>|3]</small> Sadly I have only seen this with fully grown men. I can usually tell within seconds if HE is going to tell me what I need or if he is going to be a little bitch about it.<small>[4|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;"> Then I shame the fuck out of them by telling them what they want to hear. “I am unworthy of your knowledge apparently, so I will fuck off somewhere else. I didn’t realize you were perfect, my apologies oh great one.” I don't care if he is the goddamn president, dicks like that can go fuck a brick wall. (Vent over, sorry you had to read that). They usually end up apologizing to me later and I get to watch them in their shame. So satisfying. I hold back the acceptance just a little while longer, making them think I wont accept it for a few seconds. Almost feels better than a paycheck.</span><small>|4]</small></td>

</table><br/><h2> Correlation to Socionics Type </h2><hr/>The table below serves to determine the most likely Socionics type of the subject.<br/>For calculation of the table's fields the following algorithm was used. Each of the marked up passages of the text is checked for accordance with the type model of the 16 types. If the passage accords with a TIM model, then the Accord field for that model is incremented by 1. In case of discordance, the respective Discord field gets incremented by 1. <br/><br/>The column “Correlation Factor” shows the normalized Correlation Factor which is calculated for each type according to the formula:<br/><code> Correlation Factor = NORM<small style="vertical-align:sub;color:black">100</small>(Accord/Discord)</code><br/>This method is used to the most likely type, but does not list the likelihood of the subject being any respective type. <br/><br/><table title="TIM analysis" border="1" width="80%" class="styled-table" style="border-collapse: collapse"><tr>	<th width="40%">Sociotype</th>	<th width="20%">Accord</th>	<th width="20%">Discord</th>	<th width="20%">Correlation Factor</th></tr><tr>
