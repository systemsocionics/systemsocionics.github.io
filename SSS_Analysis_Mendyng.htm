<small>[9|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">There are no objective criteria for determining the professionalism or unprofessionalism of a job, because every job is a service provided to an audience, and the audience varies totally based on the people you find. A comedian might be funny to x but not to y, consequently it is impossible to define him or her as objectively funny, as the very concept of humor is subjective. The same varies for more basic jobs: only here the standard of criteria is more similar, so one would be considered professional by "more people" in what he does: a carpenter has predefined techniques for the purposes for which wood is needed, for example. But if the need for tables disappeared and the need for wood carvings took over, then the old techniques of a "professional" carpenter would become useless. Consequently, it is impossible to define the professionalism of a person or job.</span><small>|9]</small></td>

There are 2 methods of obtaining an estimate, based on totally subjective criteria:<br/>
	- <small>[10|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">Use a method, external point of view, and apply those criteria to each job to compare them with each other and get who is more professional and who is less.

<b>What makes a job well done? What standards do you use? When should you deviate from this standard?</b></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

The question is very similar to the previous one.<br/>
Anyway, a job well done totally depends on the criteria used to define job well done. Again, you can use two main types of criteria, which I defined already in the last question. My standard is to compare the work with other work: <small>[14|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">however, I admit that sometimes I also go by feeling, as my intuition often goes beyond my conscious thought. In a way, it is as if I have a continuous stream of thought that goes much faster than my conscious thought, and the solution to every problem is always in my nonconscious stream of thought. In fact, I am really not very conscious of things, and I have difficulty paying attention. I have great difficulty in introspection; I need external reference points to logically determine my own behavior.</span><small>|14]</small> <small>[15|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">So it is impossible to define the standards I use in a constant, as I myself do not know them: I am not "conscious" of my decisions, when I need to analyze them, I go by hypothesis, like a historian trying to reconstruct history from sources. I go to fill in the blanks with the greatest probability of events. It is also difficult to determine when I deviate from the standard I usually use, as I probably always deviate based on the situation.</span><small>|15]</small></td>

</b><b>
</b>As I said before, I act according to stimuli and what I find most interesting. <small>[17|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">I move when something moves me from my current situation, I find it hard to admit but I have a comfort zone that is far too wide: I have fixed habits that are difficult to change unless I make an effort to go outside my comfort zone. </span><small>|17]</small>I would say it's an extreme difficulty in adapting due to autism (diagnosed), but also due to tendencies of my parents (but I don't get into family drama). If I am in motion enough, then I conserve the momentum to keep acting on what stimulates me the most. If I am not in motion, then I act on what is easiest, or resonates best with my comfort zone. Let me give an example.</td>

Let's pretend, I have a job that pays 2000 euros a month, with an appreciation level of 5/10. For example being an employee of a technology company: <small>[18|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I would appreciate being at the computer, but I don't appreciate the routine at all, I would get so tired of sitting 8 hours a day in the same place every time.</span><small>|18]</small> Next, I am offered a job that always pays 2000 euros a month, with an appreciation level of 7/10. For example being a voice actor or an artist, these are more creative jobs that would inspire me much more. The problem is that for the second job I would have to move more, to more different places possibly farther away from my regular workplace.</td>
<td>{18: Te✕Si;} <br/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<small>[19|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">Then the choice depends on what condition I am in:<br/>
- If I am in my comfort zone, then I would probably put off the decision until the end, and eventually I would not take the new job and stay in what I am used to. My being in my comfort zone depends on whether there is momentum by my actions.<br/>
- If I am out of my comfort zone, then I would immediately accept the job to try new experiences, and I would probably feel significantly better by using the moment to "rotate" even more and do something I would appreciate more.<br/>
Therefore, I'm making an effort every day to act outside my comfort zone so that I can stay in motion, have as much energy as possible, and do as many things as possible so that I can get a taste of everything the world has to offer. And maybe then I can even find something that I will really enjoy.</span><small>|19]</small></td>

<b>What does “logical” mean to you? Does it match the normal view? How do you know you are behaving in a logical way?</b></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<small>[20|</small><span style="background-color:#d9d2e9;">I think current thinking regarding logic falls into many flaws derived from logic itself. I think every single thought is logical, including emotions (which I see as thoughts) as simply reactions to information received from the external environment. Thought is not only logical when it uses criteria that can be shared by all humans, as many philosophers think, instead I think it is always logical. Every single idea comes from a chain of causes and effects that lead to thinking that same idea, saying "the earth is flat" is as logical as saying it is round, indifferently of the truth. Consequently no, it is not a normal point of view.</span><small>|20]</small> I often do not know whether I am behaving logically, in that I do not know how I am behaving at all. I need an external point of view to define my behavior, and my feelings, also to be able to analyze them, as I said before, with the method of the "historian": taking sources and filling in the spaces in between with hypotheses. In a more general sense, I think all behavior is logical, therefore worthy of analysis.</td>

I give an example using the historian's method:<br/>
	<small>[21|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Let's pretend that X makes me sad. I do not notice that it makes me sad, so I go to person A and he tells me that he sees me in a similar way to the emotion of sadness. I link sadness (1) to possibilities of causes of sadness (x, y, and z) happened recently. By analyzing the causes, I go on to define the cause that has the highest probability, or in some cases several causes put together.</span><small>|21]</small> I use this method to define my behavior at any time, even while writing this questionnaire: I am analyzing my behavior from external sources in my memory.</td>

<tr>
<td>

<small>[22|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;background-color:#d0e0e3;">It's kind of a hard question since it always depends. When someone, for instance, tells me that I look sad, or that something looks wrong in me, I might externally reject them and say that it's wrong (since I'm not conscious of my emotional reactions</span><small>|22]</small> - <small>[23|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">why should I be sad if I don't know I'm sad?), but then I almost always try to find the inherent causes to my sadness, primarly in the most recent events that happened and what changed from day to day, but If I not find a solution there, I might hypothesize that I didn't satisfy an "inherent need" of my being.</span><small>|23]</small> <small>[24|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Let me make an example: Someone tells me that I look happier than usual, obviously I'm not much conscious of it if I don't stop at any moment and think clearly about my emotions.</span><small>|24]</small><br/>
 <br/>
I impulsively reject the idea that I'm happier than usual, since I don't immediately resonate with it.        <small>[25|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Then, I go and analyze for myself what could have made me seem "happier": did I sleep more, maybe less? Did I get carried away in the energy of a conversation? Did I make any interesting logical conclusion in the past days? Did I talk with more people than usual?</span><small>|25]</small> Did I complete all of my objectives of "trying to fit into a routine" yesterday? <small>[26|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Maybe the comfort of this house gives me more pleasant sensations than those gave by the house I stayed in before? </span><small>|26]</small>What is my energy like, what did I eat, <small>[27|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">how much am I out of my comfort zone (out of "moving only based on inertia")?</span><small>|27]</small> <small>[28|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Out of these possible causes, I look at what effectively changed over the course of the last days, compare it to what is part of my routine, and then decide on what effectively changed my energy. Let's imagine that I come to the conclusion that switching places while doing something gives me energy. Then, I try to fix into my head the habit of changing places just to get new stimuli, sometimes I change positions of things inside my room just to feel better, or I study outside and sometimes inside, or I stay for a few days at different houses: </span><small>|28]</small></td>

Like any thought, it is logical.<small>[35|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;"> In this case, it is easy to determine that it is logical as well for someone who thinks differently from me, since it is easy to determine the cause and effect of that thought. Socrates probably assumes that it is impossible to know the criteria of nature without applying other external criteria: therefore, it is logical to conclude that the only thing one can really know, is to know nothing. I don't think anyone could disagree, since the only possible argument for why such thinking is not logical is that it is possible to know everything one comes into contact with, consequently one always knows "something."</span><small>|35]</small> But here it is a matter of receiving information, and as we see human perception confronted with truth. <small>[36|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">              </span><small>[37|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">For Parmenides there is the way of truth and the way of opinion, I don't agree so much.

Logical contradictions are almost always limitations of humanity: something can contradict something else if it exists on another logical plane. </span><small>|36]</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">People often come to infinite discussions about politics and philosophy without concluding anything precisely because they are looking at different planes of logic.</span><small>|37]</small></td>

In this case, I'm talking about society and others, but I might be a little contradictory here: as I am, in reality, very "protective" of my own space. When I talk about my own space, I mean mostly my room, or my REALLY close relatives. It is because I have a strict sense of privacy and I hate it when other see and can react to anything that I'm doing, it's exhausting. When my dad is upstairs for example, I "fear" going there, not because he's aggressive or something, but because the only presence of a person means that I can possibly heard in anything that I say to myself, or anything that I do can be seen (even something as stupid as eating, or studying). The exposure of my actions to anyone makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. But I think it mostly is so for my close relatives: I only have a "strict sense of privacy" in relation to them, and <small>[54|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">I don't care for things that other people often get crazy about, for example, exposure of my data to big companies, or in general exposure of my information to someone who I don't know.

Then. I will write a lot here. <br/>
<small>[71|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d9d2e9;">To define the concept of "willpower" according to my point of view, I must first define what consciousness is for me. It seems a distant concept, but it is actually obligatory.<br/>
Information is absorbed by people's minds equally: there are no minds that can absorb more information than others, the same goes for animals. Moreover, information is not quantifiable as it is derived. The only thing quantifiable is consciousness: the order that is applied to the information one receives. The information received is divided into groups, and the difference in size of these groups determines the size or otherwise of consciousness. An animal divides information into larger groups because its brain does not have the capacity to divide it into smaller groups-it would take more energy to do so. As a result, an animal will have a more superficial view of life. Any information about survival will be simplified into a macrocategory "survival," for example. The same concept can be applied to humans: the shallower ones will create larger groups with the information provided, so they will create fewer groups. While the deeper ones will create more groups, so they will come closer to the narrow definition of information. However, it is impossible to determine information strictly: it is like saying that 7 is no closer than 3 to infinity, since infinity itself is infinitely far from any number. The same thing applies to information: it is infinitely divisible, so the concept that a larger consciousness (smaller groups) will be more accurate than a smaller consciousness does not apply. You can visualize it as a picture: information is a picture of infinite size, and the consciousnesses of living beings are people watching the picture. Smaller, therefore more superficial, consciousnesses will be closer to the picture: therefore they will be able to notice details more, but they will not be able to see what is beyond their visual range.<br/>
Larger, thus deeper, consciousnesses will be further from the picture: thus they will be able to see a wider range, but will have difficulty noticing the smallest details. Similarly, grouping information into larger groups allows more immediate access to information within the group, but less accurately (not strictly speaking), while grouping it into smaller groups allows more accurate access to information (again not strictly speaking).</span><small>|71]</small> Now, having defined consciousness, one can define willpower.<small>[72|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">      </span><small>[73|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Willpower is the capacity to act. The ability to act is directly proportional to the ease of access to information, hence to a small consciousness, hence to noticing more of the details of the picture, hence to superficiality.</span><small>|73]</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;"> Consequently, a person with high willpower is a superficial person. Mind you, one can also act with less willpower: but it will be more difficult. </span><small>|72]</small>I do not consider myself a person with high willpower, so it is more difficult for me to focus on individual details and act on them.</td>

And communication by definition is compressed, which is one of the reasons why logical fallacies arise, which often exist because of the limitations of communication itself. One of my goals is to find the closest type of communication to pure information exchange: like a programmer who instead of working with C++ or Java works by writing binary code directly. I want to find the "binary code" of human thoughts. A dream of mine is to develop a machine capable of transporting consciousness from one mind to another: however, it will never be possible in the strict sense, because the memory of the transferred consciousness itself is immediately affected by the receiving consciousness, so the transferred consciousness will never be the same as the initial one. This is a mystery that will never be solved.</span><small>|89]</small><small>[90|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">     </span><small>[91|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">Expressions, like verbal communication, never express the pure state</span><small>|90]</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">: they express it in a compressed, deviated way. One can simplify a method of linking expressions to human states by using the norm: not the objective norm, but the subjective norm, since expressions may not connect to what people normally understand as sadness or happiness. It is never inappropriate to express one's feelings if they make sense with the context. All the limits placed on it should go away. I don't think this thought is the norm either, as many people think that smiling always means being happy.</span><small>|91]</small></td>

<small>[92|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;"></b>What I mean is that, there's certainly an objective pattern in how people express their feelings (as Individuality is based on principles which are applicable to every "mind": personality follows some patterns from which it's impossible to deviate from, if not over time and with enough knowledge of how a human brain works), but people should not limit themselves to the superficialities of expression of emotions, and instead adapt their understanding based on who they're talking to.

This is quite a complicated question, I could expand a lot, go into detail and explain my worldview, but there are so many things I don't know where to start. As a child, I took it for granted that everyone theorized about their surroundings from an early age, in fact, <small>[155|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I took it for a long time that everyone thought like me and simply didn't show it, but during my adolescence I slowly learned how shallow the average thinking is, how people are unable to go to the depths of the issues, of the "truth." I am sure that I have the truth within me: but it is very difficult to put it into words, which is why I push myself to study every day to learn concepts that have already been explained, and make it easier to communicate my ideas.</span><small>|155]</small> I could say that as a child I took it for granted that everything was relative, but that would be too superficial, as such thinking cannot be represented in normal words. <small>[156|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">It is fun to talk about the different possibilities about the truth of the world, but it is fundamentally useless: the communication of logic as itself is useless, as every thought is compressed by communication into a single layer. The only way to arrive at an objective truth shared by all would be to achieve the purest possible communication: logically impossible by the very theory of information exchange. Consequently, it is impossible to reach a truth shared by all, even under forced brainwashing. We can reason following the laws of classical logic (Determinacy, Bivalence, True-functionality), following Aristotle and what the ancients taught us, but we can never reach an objective truth, the very concept of it makes it impossible to understand it.</span><small>|156]</small></td>

Well, I could go into detail or not, there's really a lot to say and it's hard to decide where to start. <small>[159|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;background-color:#d0e0e3;">As I already said, there are "bigger" and "smaller" consciousnesses. This is dettated by how the brain perceives information and automatically divides it: a bigger consciousness will divide information into smaller groups, therefore it will be "closer" to the "real" information (whenever it is really closer also depends on  what information REALLY is, and if it is quantifiable or not.        I'm ready to change my opinion about this little detail, but it doesn't change in any way the inherent structure of my system). Careful, this doesn't mean that there are superior and inferior people. Just that some people are inherently closer to the "truth" in their automatic process of information. As an example, a smaller consciousness will divide the same information into "Family" and "Survival". A bigger consciousness, will automatically divide into smaller groups: "Brother" "Sister" "Parents" "Water" "Food" "Work".</span><small>|159]</small> <small>[160|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;">Obviously it is a really simplified example. But, in how people approach the world, there will be a decisive difference in the approach.      </span><small>[161|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">Smaller consciousnesses will have a more "visceral" view of life, but they will be more able to easily act based on their needs. Bigger consciousnesses will have a more general, philosophical view to life, but will have difficulty focusing on only one aspect of it.</span><small>|161]</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;"> I'll send a poorly made drawing that represents consciousness using the "picture" method: [A drawing of two people viewing two points, the first only views B and the circle of their view is substantially smaller compared to the second, which circle views both points]</span><small>|160]</small></td>

<small>[162|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">Obviously it is not an accurate representation of the theory, but more or less using a scrap from an old theory of mine (how the perspectives of all people are inherently caused by a chain of cause-effect events, and the objective characteristics have to coincide with the subjective characteristics: therefore all perspectives can be "represented" as eyes watching a picture from different directions and distances).</span><small>|162]</small> <small>[163|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;background-color:#d0e0e3;">But it gets over the concept pretty well. Being the work of the mind inherently related to the perspectives of others, information has to be objective: there can't exist an objective principle which elaborates subjective ones, at least it's what I think now. Whenever a bigger consciousness is effectively "closer" to the truth depends on the view anyone can have over information and reality itself: if information is not quantifiable, then the picture in the bad drawing is of infinite size. Therefore it's impossible to be conscious of every single information, and consequently, it's impossible to know the truth. Therefore, it's useless to "talk" about the truth when inherently it's impossible to know it: it's impossible that two different consciousnesses coincide on the same point of view, and at the same time it's impossible for one consciousness to see all of the picture. Consequently, one person cannot really "coincide" or "agree" with another on their view of reality: they are just agreeing on their personal idea of reality, derived from the object of the system (the person from which the piece of information is received). Obviously this might not be true, there are things that need to be taken for granted: for example, the objectivity and measurability of the psyche. But if it weren't for these things, then it would mean that either objective principles of the psyche don't exist (which contradicts psychology), or there exist something which is not measurable: which would mean that there is something abstract that controls us.</span><small>|163]</small></td>

Personally, I don't believe in God, I think it is a very superficial way of perceiving reality. But I see how people could come to the conclusion of an objective, abstract, immaterial principle.

My approach in the search of the truth is quite complicated, I often take for granted information that is not there as it is intuitive.

Obviously it might be wrong and inaccurate since it's much faster and unconscious, but the same can be applied to conscious thinking. So, people should try to logically value their intuition, and construct on it: not de-value it.</span><small>|168]</small></td>

Some minutes later, he gets hit by a car and either dies or ends up at the hospital (because he wasn't careful, obviously). One slight change in time (a difference of one minute) can end up in either one person living, or dead: the same can be deductively applied to all the little actions that everyone does all the time. Maybe one time an primary school teacher gets a cold, and can't go to school: one of the students gets sad, and so he performs badly. Performing badly, he gets undervalued compared to the other students: so he continues to perform even worse, goes to a worse school later in his life, and in general gets tired of studying and begins working at McDonald's as early as possible. He gets kicked from the house of his strict parents because they think he is a failure, and he ends up as a homeless man. If the teacher didn't get a cold, then this person might have continued to perform well, and go on and live a fulfilling life, pursuing a higher level of education.</span><small>|173]</small> I don't know, I think it's something really obvious.</td>

So in this case, I'm actually really comfortable with doing some "reverse-unfolding" as past events have some concrete details that can be analyzed to see how they connect between each other.

And the only way to really do so, is through analyzing the principles of the system that constitute that "change in time": if I were to know how relationships work objectively, then I would be able to easily predict if that relationship would end up in a ""bad"" way or ""good"" way, for example, anyone would be able to do it</span><small>|188]</small>.

Time is my life.

There are many problems with the world, but solving them would only lead to more problems. It is impossible to undo them, as human consciousness itself is dictated by adaptation to new information.

I think there might be a misunderstanding. I'm not saying that teachers don't work, neither I'm judging the value of people. Also, I'm not saying that this is the only solution: the most extreme and ideal is, in fact, almost never the one who is able to satisfy all parties. Sorry if that might appear rude! But it's all theoretical work. <small>[214|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">If I say something controversial like "school teachers shouldn't exist" I'm not saying it because of the present inherent value of people: but because an ideal society would be, for me (and for what I think is the best solution for progress)</span><small>|214]</small>, <small>[215|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">a hyper-personalized one, where each one would be able to reach 100% of their full potential.</span><small>|215]</small> Being dependent on a factor which also influences other 20/25 people, means that the same concept of hyperpersonalization is "impossible" if applied to the present system. <small>[216|</small><span style=background-color:#f4cccc>The same can be said about everything that I say in regards to society: it's not something that would be able to be applied now, but something that in the right situation might be a perfect system. An utopia you could say. I think we should all strive for perfection, in both society and ourselves: I hate when people say something like "this is just who I am" when they do something bad or that hurts others, without trying to improve themselves. The same can be said about people who say "but it's an utopia, therefore it's useless to talk about since humans are imperfect".</span><small>|216]</small> <small>[217|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">That's literally the point, being imperfect beings we "should" strive to be perfect (even if it's theoretically impossible), and follow an ideal in its best possibility of use and utility in reality.</span><small>|217]</small> <small>[218|</small><span style=background-color:#f4cccc>I'm not that aggressive about it though, in the end everyone can do what he wants for himself, and if someone continues to "don't improve themselves" I don't stop talking to them or something like that, I end up being extremely accomodating and justifying every little piece of behavior, it's something natural.</span><small>|218]</small><br/>
So, coming back to the controversial topic, I'm not saying, again, something arrogant and not true like that school teachers don't work (in the present system) or that it's the only solution. One, I'm not able to judge how people work as individuals and I don't think I've ever done so: I'm not God (or maybe I am? Does God exist?)<br/>
Two, there are multiple solutions: and honestly almost every single other one would be better than the hyper-personalized one if applied to present society, since there are many different adaptations that would need to be done. So, I'm not judging the present, it's something I'm not able to do and I think no one should do if not without a decent dose of knowledge.<br/>
What I'm doing, instead, is build up based on the future, and abstract concepts. You can say that it's a sort of deductive thinking.<br/>
<small>[219|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">Obviously, it's extremely simplified</span><small>|219]</small>, but what do I think that is the ultimate goal of humanity? Progress. What system would be able to make everyone strive the most for progress? A hyper-personalized one, where with enough knowledge of the brain, each one's potential is achieved. The specific depends inherently from the general: if the goal where to change, ex. Humanity didn't exist for progress but for love of cats, then I'd create a system where cats rule the world, it's as simple as that. If there were to be a different variable which I've not accounted for in the structure of the system (and not in how humans are imperfect), then I would immediately change it. But, as I'm saying again, I'm not judging the present: I don't have the power to do so. It's not that teachers don't work, but that in an abstract subjective utopia created for a single objective which might not even be the real objective of humanity, the concept of knowledge being dependent on other people goes against that same structure, therefore should not exist in the most extreme existence of that system (because it would be literally impossible). I hope it's explained <br/>
in a better way this time, as sometimes I just let thoughts flow.</td>

Also, when I say this: "all of this is possible nowadays", I'm talking about the specific role of hyper-personalization in school, which I instead think is something obtainable in the shorter term, even with compromises. I can also go the other way and instead go from the specific to the general: the actual system involves a student listening to a teacher in the same class, often there are multiple teachers based on the subjects and the number of students in the class varies. What would need to be improved to maybe make learning more adaptive to the student? Teachers should comunicate thoughts clearly, and use interactive tools. Okay, some basics there. What is the next step? There should be no bias on the students, everyone should be judged equally. Ok, now teachers have another skill to account for, even if it's common sense. What might be the next step? Maybe the teachers should not only try to communicate their thoughts clearly, but should know how to do so: they should learn to entertain the students with their information, so that attention is at its peak even for students who don't really care. Okay, it sounds strange... Why care for students who don't care? It's easy: potential. We're talking about potential here, which is the ultimate objective of a personalized or hyper-personalized system. Maybe one student does not want to study simply because of external criteria, and if he were in a different context he'd study like crazy. Therefore, adaptive context also means a better progress towards potential, primarly in the first stages of development. Let's come back to the example now. So, the teachers now have to use interactive tools, eliminate all biases, know how to comunicate and keep attention on them... What should be the next step towards an easier exchange of information? Well, maybe the teachers should know a bit about the student's brains as to know what form of information is the best to explain what they mean to explain. Maybe they should know about learning styles, and use all the tools available to don't have a style easier to access than others. Maybe they should know a bit about about psychology and the basis of how the brain works as to act in the best way according to the students reactions... You see where this is going. After a bit, all of this becomes impossible for a human to keep in mind, a more personalized system would necessarily mean that the role of a teacher would become even harder than what it was before, and even rare. The total absence of biases and an adaptive learning are impossible if the center of both those variables is a human who might even go crazy over all of these requirements. Teachers even get too much work to do now, and sometimes it gets transferred to the students in forms of anger and biases. As you can see, going over the process of personalization as of now would only be destructive for the whole system. But what if the center of information, and the one who should be able to handle all of this, wasn't human? Instead of focusing on or own imperfections, why don't we create something that covers them? After all, it's certain that a human would not be able to handle that much information to keep in mind (and also knowledge is something so important that it shouldn't be in the hands of people to explain, but this is just my thought and it's extremely subjective). But a different ""life"" form, created to be able to handle more information, might fix all these issues. And it actually does, and it would be the only mean through to reach a hyper-personalization of learning. You can retrace all the steps back that I did for the example: you'll see that with something which doesn't have biases by its same nature, and is able to handle much more information than a human, we can keep going. Obviously it fixes those issues, but it creates others: like occupation, ethical questions and money, but the system should, in my opinion, be adjusted according to the needs for knowledge.<br/>
All those nuances should be fixed according to the most ideal solution for the long-term development of humanity: that's why I'm saying that it's possible now more than ever to make the next step. Again, an extremely subjective opinion, but I honestly think that we should adapt politics and economics to the need for progress: not the contrary. Seeing the big picture, watching teachers get replaced by robots, to me would be the same kind of step that we've seen centuries ago with the automation of production, but yet people only take this last one for granted, and see all other possible improvements as redundant and "taking away the humanity from humans". I actually think it's the contrary, making hard jobs automated would only make us more easily use our full potential of being humans.</td>

</table><br/><h2> Correlation to Socionics Type </h2><hr/>The table below serves to determine the most likely Socionics type of the subject.<br/>For calculation of the table's fields the following algorithm was used. Each of the marked up passages of the text is checked for accordance with the type model of the 16 types. If the passage accords with a TIM model, then the Accord field for that model is incremented by 1. In case of discordance, the respective Discord field gets incremented by 1. <br/><br/>The column “Correlation Factor” shows the normalized Correlation Factor which is calculated for each type according to the formula:<br/><code> Correlation Factor = NORM<small style="vertical-align:sub;color:black">100</small>(Accord/Discord)</code><br/>This method is used to the most likely type, but does not list the likelihood of the subject being any respective type. <br/><br/><table title="TIM analysis" border="1" width="80%" class="styled-table" style="border-collapse: collapse"><tr>	<th width="40%">Sociotype</th>	<th width="20%">Accord</th>	<th width="20%">Discord</th>	<th width="20%">Correlation Factor</th></tr><tr>
