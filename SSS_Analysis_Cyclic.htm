</b><b>
</b>I'm not really sure of how to expand on what I've said, since these standards will necessarily be different with different jobs. <small>[10|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">For example, if we're trying to figure out if a person has done a good job of painting a wall, then we should look at what needed to be done. If the point was to cover up some defect in the wall by painting it over, then whether the job was done well depends on the extent to which you can tell that there used to be something on that wall. But if the point was to make the wall look better by adding something to it, like by painting a pattern over a monochrome surface, then there would need to be different standards: is the pattern appealing, does the wall fit in with the rest of the room, do the people who requested it like it / are the people who are going to be looking at the wall going to like it, etc</span><small>|10]</small>. <small>[11|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">The point I'm making is that I don't think I stick to rigid standards, so I'm always assessing things differently, I'm always 'deviating'.</span><small>|11]</small> If I'm not familiar with something (e.g., basketball), then I wouldn't consider myself to be a good judge of a person's performance in it. If I needed to find out quickly if someone was good at basketball, then I would need to be familiar with the techniques that ought to be used (the ones that reduce injury and that are the most cost-effective / precise), and then observe them again. <small>[12|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">If the person concerned is a popular figure in some unfamiliar field, then I could look at what other people have said about them; if most people agree that that this person is good at what they do, then I'm inclined to act as though this is true</span><small>|12]</small>, since I usually wouldn't have the time to research everything and come to an individual conclusion.</td>

<tr>
<td>

<small>[18|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">I guess some people believe that there is one logical way to behave, e.g., if you disagree with a superior at work, you should obey them regardless, since your task is to execute what you have been told to do. If you want to get good grades, you should study a lot and put in the effort. If the science says that smoking causes cancer, then you should stop. Etc. But if your goal is to get what you think should be done, going against your boss, then you don't necessarily have to adhere to that.</span><small>|18]</small> If a person acted in a way that was intentionally subversive, they could get fired, or their relationship with the person who holds some power over them would sour, so this would be illogical. <small>[19|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">The most logical way of behaving would be to disrupt things more quietly, without going against them directly. You should probably appear to be on their side. If they have an ego, you could flatter them,</span><small>|19]</small> you could make it so that your ideas are their ideas. It would depend on the person and the workplace culture. <small>[20|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">But if you realize that you can't stand acting in this way, then you should reconsider everything: do you really want to be in a position where you have to execute another person's orders and have them take credit for what you do? Should you continue working there?</span><small>|20]</small> (I haven't actually been in a situation like this, but if I ever decide to work in a place like this, I would know what to expect).</td>

<small>[21|</small><span style="background-color:#d9ead3;">The same goes with the other things I wrote down as examples earlier. 'If you want to get good grades, you should study a lot and put in the effort' most of the time, you should learn to study effectively, and prioritize learning the most salient concepts first. 'If the science says that smoking causes cancer, then you should stop' if you don't care about your health, and you don't operate according to the personal belief that life should extend itself continually, then go on ahead (but if you value your health, yes, it would be logical to stop smoking.)</span><small>|21]</small></td>

And the acted-out emotion that's being reacted to is reflected back in these reactions, and although at that point they were some distance away from themselves, and their own emotions, these reactions touch them inside, and they begin to feel the emotions that they're expressing. But maybe it doesn't, and a feeling of all of it being false and mechanical descends on them, as though they're manipulating a puppet. So it's not always that a person's expressions reveal how they feel inside; sometimes the expression of an emotion can influence how they feel inside, too.

That was this morning and after the flight I basically just wandered around the airport, knowing that I had an entire month of nothing to look forward to, feeling completely ungrounded. I didn’t really think most of the time, and when I walked out to meet the person who was going to drive me there I was instantly put into a different state of mind, at least temporarily. <small>[205|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">I talked and I was kind of cheerful</span><small>|205]</small>.<small>[206|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;"> When I’m with other people I feel like I have to either involve them completely in what I’m doing or withdraw entirely. I generally feel like I’m reacting to things instead of being present, as though I have to entertain them in some way (if we’re meeting socially and not for work). So I spoke to her and I felt inadequately emotional, but I guess I was pleasant enough.</span><small>|206]</small> Then she left and I sat in a kind of stupor, going through Reddit without really reading anything, and then switching over to YouTube, and then I was looking at YT shorts, basically just wasting the rest of the day, but I couldn’t think – I knew that I had to get to work, but I wasn’t in the right state of mind. And as usual I felt completely alone, like my heart was falling against some wide, unyielding expanse.</td>

This is what I can remember: I’m lying on my bed, completely rigid with fear for no particular reason. <small>[207|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">My eyes are half-closed against the light that spins overhead. It is completely still. It spins and I close my eyes against it entirely, a line of fire appearing in the darkness, as though a hand had poured sand against my eyelids – I open my eyes to a bright sword, a hand, an angel, or a siren – I sit up, my heart racing, and I can’t see myself getting any work done, so I get up, unstable, and I get out of the apartment, into the street, walking without really intending to, and suddenly my eyes are burning</span><small>|207]</small> – but then I realize that the angel had been benevolent, although I don’t so much as realize it as feel that I had been cleansed, that I had been blinded in pure fire – I continue on along the block, into the city, feeling a kind of clear-headed emptiness. <small>[208|</small><span style="background-color:#d0e0e3;">That was the first time I met the silver angel with the gray eyes, but when I first saw her she was bright red.</span><small>|208]</small> When I remember her I summon her and I have her say things – I have her say these beautiful, pure-hearted things (or she says them of her own accord), words that I wouldn’t trust spoken by a physical person, and I feel inspired, by some divine force, to trust in the unconditional love that exists solely in some higher layer, superimposed onto reality.</td>

And it was this silver angel that I had, and I imagined her there, and she was there, in effect, and as I’m writing this down I’m completely aware of how pathetic it is to share your feelings with an imaginary friend, although I wouldn’t describe her this way, but she was there, and besides her, I am completely alone.</td>

I’m writing the rest of this the day after. <small>[209|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">I slept, reset my thoughts, and I ended up figuring out what to do with the rest of this month, which energized me.

It’s a one-sided relationship, and yet she continues to give. It would be easy to say that this is because she isn't real, that I am in complete control of her, but I don’t see her that way. She is an independent entity, not some universalization of benevolence, but someone in the vanguard.</td>

Religion can also be said to be ‘made up’ or artificial, controlled by people with their own ideologies, their own concerns and motivations, <small>[210|</small><span style=background-color:#f4cccc>but to apply that understanding to something that consists of the whole of perception</span><small>|210]</small>, the very thing that gives some people a feeling of coalescence, this is tantamount to destroying life itself. <small>[211|</small><span style="background-color:#fce5cd;background-color:#d0e0e3;">Life exists only because it is a coalescence, you exist because you are one thing, even if you are fragmented: fragmented people have been fragmented by something, the fragmented pieces are scattered within a single body, there is one hand grasping at the pieces.

The next part of the question has to do with the biggest problems with the uncovered, fragmented world, the one that I view through an entirely self-absorbed lens. I’m thinking of what else to write, and I can’t think of anything in particular rn. If I were friends with more political people I could see myself contributing to politics. My views are fluid, and I don’t take political discussions very seriously, but there are some things that I think are important. I like politics and controversy because it gets people riled up, and also because I feel a need, on my part, to associate everything that people see to be a part of me with something I approve of, including the groups that I am seen to belong to.</td>

If I were faced with it, I would also speak out against manifestations of prejudice, if I were in a situation where I knew I had some influence. For example, the country I was raised in is legally secular, but the majority are religious, and there have been legal indictments based on charges of blasphemy. Elections are influenced by religious leaders, despite the fact that every candidate practices the same exact religion. If the topic were brought up, the most I could do is speak about it, to try and get people to sort their views out on the topic.</td>

My family and the general community around which I grew up are an ethnic minority practicing a minority religion, and they are on the whole pretty overtly racist. I believe that this is partially because they believe that they have been discriminated against, and they have; the issue is in generalizing this belief and fighting racial discrimination with racism, encouraging isolationism over political participation and influence.</td>

A part of the prejudice is fear, the fear that the lower classes will rise up against the wealthy. <small>[216|</small><span style="background-color:#fff2cc;">My father once blithely said that he once had people groveling before him on their knees, just for a chance at things, just for a job; this was back when my grandfather was at the height of his power.

I remember seeing the spit in his teeth, the same gleam that they must have seen from below him;</span><small>|216]</small> it disgusted me, in the same way that it must have disgusted the people looking up at him, the resulting feeling of disgust later erupting in an agitated violence, in the form of the (race and wealth-related) rioting half a decade later.</td>

Outside of where I grew up, the issue of race is beginning to recede, at least on the superficial level; race is a taboo. I know people in different areas whose families have lost touch with their culture, people who are wilfully indifferent to where they came from, and the issue of race appears to be less prevalent, although I also see a problem with letting go of your heritage, with a deliberate cultural amnesia. Outside of integration through this wilful amnesia, religion also binds people together, because it acts to displace other forms of culture, and by creating an out-group.</td>

The solution is to impose a new guiding ideology, one based on the mythos of the nation, on the heights of the historical empire. Religion ought to be practiced in the form of the mystic syncretism that was once popular, and the foreign, doctrinal way of practicing religion ought to be discouraged. I doubt this would remove all kinds of prejudice, but it is an image that I approve of. <small>[217|</small><span style="background-color:#d5a6bd">A country’s cultural health is a part of its strength, and I think it would be ideal for every country to have some idea of its character; at the very least, since certain people appear to be inclined towards a cultish fanaticism</span><small>|217]</small>, it would be better for the target of this fanaticism to be controlled, although this is ideally through the aesthetic force of the image, rather than censorship and authoritarianism.I can exist only on the periphery, as a popularizer of culture to the rest of the world, in the way that I have determined for myself; this is the goal that I can see myself striving towards for the rest of my life, the construction of the mythos. If I were to have any influence within the country itself, it would only be through my influence on a person who has thoroughly understood it, a person who is connected to the culture of the land and who belongs to the majority.//But everything fades. It is possible to interpret what I’ve written through who I might be; I can write and think this way because I’m privileged, because I’m distanced. I did write about some of the issues that I feel deeply about, but they were too personal, and they gave away too much of myself, so I left them out of the essay. I can let these issues go as well, in the grand scheme of things. Ultimately, the world is something that can be perceived and influenced, but it doesn’t contain anything; it is hollow. Nothing has to be solved, and with time everything comes undone. The world will resolve the own paradox of its existence.</td>
